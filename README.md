## Biological Ontology Cluster Comparison (BOCC)
BOCC Leverages the knowledge contained with in resources like the STRING protein-ptotein-interaction networks and the Human Phenotype Ontology to hypothesis about latent gene-to-phenotype connections. The CLI and Web App below provides access to clusters of genes and phenotypes where currently unconnected genes are phenotype are much more likely to be connected in the future.

BOCC is a project led by [Michael Bradshaw](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zubH4CIAAAAJ) as a part of his PhD at University of Colorado Boulder, advised by professor [Ryan Layer](https://layerlab.org/) PhD, in collaboration with Colorado State University professor [Bailey Fosdick](https://www.baileyfosdick.com/) PhD and former graduate student [Connor Gibbs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q-0bXtEAAAAJ&hl=en) PhD. 

## BOCC Interactive Platform

The BOCC project is made accessible to scientists and clinicians via github pages. The visualization is developed and maintained by Sky Martin, a software developer in the Layer Lab. BOCC web app is designed as a single page client side application ultizing D3 JavaScript and HTML.
